# Respiratory Microbiome and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Dataset Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the repository housing the dataset and associated code for the study on the respiratory microbiome and its role in Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP). This prospective observational study was conducted in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Ch√≠a, Colombia, and involved 195 adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation. The dataset provides a comprehensive collection of clinical data, microbiome analysis, and inflammatory marker quantifications, offering valuable insights into the microbial ecology of VAP and its relationship with immune dysregulation.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

Clinical Data: Collected at multiple time points during ICU admission.
Microbiome Analysis: Involves DNA extraction and 16S ribosomal gene sequencing to analyze the respiratory microbiome.
Inflammatory Markers: Quantification of pulmonary and systemic inflammatory markers using ELISA.
This dataset is ideal for researchers interested in studying the interplay between the respiratory microbiome, immune responses, and disease progression in critically ill patients.
